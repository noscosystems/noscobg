# TODO List

## Index Page
The index page for the property website should look like the design that we sketched up. Or at least as close as possible (no problem).

### Carousel
Needs to have images from Marcus but is looking MNOGO DOBRE!

### Search Area
Have some basic input fields that can be used to search with. 

### Results Area
From the search, produce some dummy results that we can view, use some images, titles, description etc.

## Pages to produce
Admin area - Allows for inserting properties as well as editing.  
We will add more when we think of them on the plane.  

## Design
Think of a design that fits with the theme to be used on pages that will not have the slider (carousel) at the top, so; normal pages.
