# TODO List

## Sections

### Index
The index page for the property website should look like the design that we sketched up. Or at least as close as possible.  
The index page needs to have:
 - A header or somethign similar with links.
 - A Carousel that rotates images.
 - A search function that will allow the user to search for properties.
 - A results area that will display the results from the property search.
 - A small footer that shows that the site was by Nosco, and I mean small. One line. :)  
  
Were hoping that Marcus can supply all the images we need, otherwise we will take matters into our own hands.  
Use dummy date for the search function until we get some actual data to insert.

### Admin Area
This will be where the users with a level of 60 or above will be able to manage the site.  
Admins should be able to do the following:  
 - Create and edit assets.
 - Create and edit users.
 - Soft deletion of assets and users (never hard deletion).
 - See basic statistics, like how many users, how many assets, how many X, Y, Z...  

### My Account
We are looking to implement an area where the user can edit details about their account and interaction which include:
 - Their personal information such as: password, email, display name.
 - Messaging other users and reading their own messages. Like an inbox.
 - See favourite assets.
 - If the user owns assets, then let them view a list and possibly edit the properties of the asset (to be confirmed).

### Translations  
This is not really a page area, but the site will require the site to be able to be translated into three languages (for now):
 - English
 - Bulgarian
 - Russian

### Service & Support  
Information regarding legal and financial services, Luke and Clive will handle this as there are several Terms of service etcs. we need to fill in.  
However, it would be nice if you could make this page (ie: set it up for us).

### Contact  
A basic page that will display contact information as well as the address of the company and who to contact for help.  
We will also put our contact details in small print somewhere here.

### About Us  
This page or section will be pretty self explanatory. We will require some interaction from Smarts for this, again just have the page set up so we can add what we need to when we want.

### Asset Details  
This page will display the asset with its images and details as such:
 - Image of asset
 - Name of asset
 - Rooms according to asset.
 - A detailed area that has plenty of descriptive details.  

### Registration  
A registration page will be required in order for users to sign up.  
The registration page should ask for basic information or the fields that are required in the user table. 

## Design
Think of a design that fits with the theme to be used on pages that will not have the slider (carousel) at the top, so; normal pages.  
Yeah fix up the design in `/application/themes/classic/views/layouts/main` when you can.

# We will be adding more to this.  
When you have completed any part of this, edit it to have a strikethrough.  
Google "Github flavoured markdown" for information on how to format this page.
